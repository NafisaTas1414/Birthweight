    "After analyzing all the data, one pattern that can be observed is that babies born to mothers who didn't smoke during pregnancy and have no history of hypertension tend to have a higher average birth weight of 6 pounds and 13.01 ounces compared to mothers who have a history of hypertension and smoking during pregnancy. As the average birth weight for them is 5 pounds and 10.34 ounces. Mothers who didn't have a history of hypertension and didn't smoke during pregnancy had the highest average. Now comparing the maximum weight we can see mothers who don't smoke and don't have hypertension can have babies who weigh up to 11 pounds and 0.01 ounces while the maximum weight for babies whose mothers did smoke during their pregnancy and do have a history of hypertension is 8 pounds and 4.49 ounces. So smoking and having a history of hypertension can result in lower birth weight for the baby. From this, it can be inferred that a mother is more likely to produce a healthier baby in terms of weight if they don't smoke during pregnancy and don't have a history of hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "One commonality that can be concluded from this analysis is the presence of low birth weights ranging from 1 pound and 9.01 ounces to 2 pounds and 8.04 ounces. This means that low birth weight is observed across all groups. Then looking at the maximum birth weights, it varies from each group. For example, the max birth weight of babies for mothers with a history of hypertension was 8 pounds and 5.69 ounces, while the max weight of babies of mothers who didn't smoke during pregnancy and didn't have hypertension was 11 pounds and 0.01 ounces. This once again shows that a baby has the potential to be at a healthier weight if the mother doesn't have a history of hypertension and doesn't smoke during pregnancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, maternal lifestyle factors like hypertension history and smoking during pregnancy play a role in the weight of babies. Smoking and having a history of hypertension can increase the chance of a baby weighing less compared to mothers who abstain from smoking during pregnancy and mothers who don't have any history of hypertension.\n"
